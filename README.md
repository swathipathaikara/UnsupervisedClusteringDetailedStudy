A study on Unsupervised Clustering methods - K-Means, K-Medoid, DBSCAN and Agglomerative Algorithms

Abstract:

This paper explores various unsupervised clustering techniques on a retail shop consumer data set. K-Means, K-Medoid, DBSCAN and Agglomerative algorithms are used for modelling. Also, a few preprocessing methods such as encoding, feature scaling, and PCA are conducted to feed the data to these models. The optimum number of clusters is determined by Elbow Method, Silhouette score Method, Calinski Harabasz score Method, Davies Bouldin Score, NearestNeighbors and Dendrogram. Models are implemented using Python programming language and the internal  performance measures obtained are visualized for comparison and discussion

Customer Relationship Management is one of the key decision factors in profit making and growth of any organization. For improved customer satisfaction and a better understanding of the client values, it is necessary to establish clear strategies to evaluate the consumer relationships with the company. Machine learning applications can guide the creation of profit-oriented marketing techniques by targeting premium clients.

Clustering validations are of two types (i) external and (ii) internal. The first one requires the predefined labels in the data set. But internal clustering does not require the ground truth for evaluating the clusters
This work focuses on centroid-based, density-based and hierarchical clustering strategies for grouping. The author used K-Means, K-Medoid, DBSCAN and Agglomerative algorithms for modelling. Finally, the Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz and Davies Bouldin scores were selected for evaluating the clusters.
